            <p class="card-text">My responsibilities as part of the replenishment team was to help unload the delivery trucks after closing hours and re-stock the shelves with new products. I am extremely physically fit and therefore was able to undertake this work with enthusiasm and energy that I expend in all my job roles. The job was rewarding as it allowed me to work with others to re-stock, design and transform the store ready for the new customer arrivals the next business day. The shift I worked commenced two hours before the store closing times during which time, I provided a high standard of customer service provision to the customers still present. I valued this customer interaction as I enjoy providing quality service and ensuring people are satisfied. During closed periods the store was still a very busy community and I worked well as part of my team undertaking not only my work but also assisting with other work in order to support my colleagues and ensure all work was carried out within set timeframes and to a high standard I was extremely flexible regarding my core hours and readily made myself available for any other shifts available day or night. The job allowed me to build a wide range of successful working relationships and helped develop my collaboration skills. It also enabled me to produce ideas for better ways of working and strategic planning of my personal workload. During my time working here I believe I was able to display excellent team work problem solving and good communication skills that culminated in good delivery and work performance overall.</p>
